# Food-Recipes-Nextjs
<br>
This repository hosts a food recipe site developed with Next.js for frontend and backend, complemented by Tailwind CSS for styling. The site offers a responsive interface for users to explore a variety of recipes presented as interactive cards. Each card leads to a detailed recipe page, displaying ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions. Data is fetched dynamically from a dummy JSON API, enhancing user interaction with real-time updates. This project aims to provide a seamless browsing experience across devices, empowering users to discover, cook, and share delicious meals effortlessly.
